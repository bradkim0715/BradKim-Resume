        My name is Brad Kim. I am currently attending the University of California, Riverside with a major in Mechanical Engineering. Innovation has always been a part of my life, ever since I was a kid. From building legoes to working on cars, the dream of being an engineer sprang to life. As I grew older, the theoretics of space travel and the future innovations of modern vehicles is something that I slowly got a grasp on and that was when I knew this was going to be my future. Previous experiences definitely influenced my decision to major in mechanical engineering. These experiences include working on motor vehicles, specifically cars, in car shops, collaborations with family in the field of mechanical research, and more to come during my time attending university. 
        As a child, I was heavily attracted to cars. The speed and looks of sports cars specifically was enough to grasp my attention during my youth. As time progressed, and I started to mature, the combination of technological advancements and the physics applied to the automobiles is what got me even more invested. With connections, I was able to visit car shops where they would modify cars, develop body kits, fix cars that customers would bring, and much more. I was given the opportunity to participate in one of the projects where they were going to install exterior modifications for the appearance of the car. I learned that there is a lot more than just cutting up the car and installing the kit. Teamwork and collaboration are crucial when it comes to completing a project. The job gets done a lot faster which allows more time for other follow-up projects. With my experience at the car shop, I am able to apply the vital skillset of collaboration in not only school settings, but work environments as well. 
        Family connections allowed me to work with a cousin of mine that works for Boeing. I was able to experience the work environment at a major company. My cousin also being a mechanical engineer was very beneficial as I was able to see what she does for the company and her role as an engineer. Getting first hand experience, I was able to quickly tell that the overall concept of engineering suits me. I was also able to realize that collaboration is still as important as ever as she has to communication and work with her co-workers often. When it came to research, which was the opportunity I was given, finding information and utilizing that knowledge to start the development of innovations was fascinating.
        In the near future, I plan on joining clubs related to mechanical engineering and finding internships alongside it as well. With the surplus of clubs readily available to join, I will participate in their events and continue to build my experience and knowledge in the field of engineering. Continuing to build my resume, I will be able to obtain an internship for an engineering company and grow from there.
